Hello! My name is Angelina Ibarra and I am a PhD student at Texas A&M University. I recieved my B.S in Electrical Engineering with a certificate in Marine Science from The University of Texas at Austin in May 2019. Following my graduation, I began my M.S in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University and graduated in May 2025. I decided to continue my education and pursue a PhD. I currently work in the [Advanced Vision and Learning Lab](https://avll.engr.tamu.edu/) under my advisor, Dr. Joshua Peeples. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning. I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning for underwater imagery and technology. Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on Linkedin!
